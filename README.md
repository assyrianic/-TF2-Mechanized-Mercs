##Features##
This mod includes 3 different gameplay modes.

Mode #1:
  Map starts out with 3 classes: Engineer, Soldier, and Officer (Spy). Vehicle classes are locked. Engineers must build vehicle constructs called mainframes to unlock vehicles. Each mainframe unlocks two different vehicles classes, each different in strengths and weakenesses.
  
  The 3 mainframes are:
    Support mainframe - unlocks Armored Car and Ambulance
    Offensive mainframe - unlocks Medium and Light tanks
    Heavy Support mainframe - unlocks King Tiger tank and the Marder 2 Tank Destroyer.

Each mainframe costs 200 metal to build.
The mainframes are buildable, destroyable, and fixable.
The mainframes can also be hit by wrenches to increase their build times.
The Officer class can aid in building the mainframes using their melee Whip.

Mode #2:
  This mode is pretty much gun game but with vehicles.
  You start off as an Armored Car and must kill other vehicles to become more powerful vehicles.
  Difference in this mode is that there are no human classes, ambulance is locked, and that Armored Car has an unlocked ability to regenerate health and the ability to capture objectives, thus making them always valuable.

Mode #3:
  This mode is normal, unmodified team fortress 2 with the exception that players of any class can BUILD Vehicles instead of building mainframes and unlocking them.
  Players can build Vehicle constructs which require metal to build up. non-Engie players can upgrade the metal requirement but they do it slowly, only Engineers can upgrade at normal rate. Each more powerful vehicle requires more metal than the last to build. Once the construct has enough metal required to run, a player can jump or touch the construct and press the Reload button to become the vehicle!
  After becoming a vehicle, you're subject to whatever the vehicle can do and what can be applied to the vehicle.
