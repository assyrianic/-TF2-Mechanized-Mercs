Mod Explanation:
  At the beginning of the map, vehicle classes are locked. Engineers must build vehicle garages to unlock the vehicles. Each garage unlocks two different vehicles classes, each different in strengths and weakenesses.
  
  The 3 garage are:
    Support garage - unlocks Armored Car and Ambulance
    Offensive garage - unlocks Medium and Light tanks
    Heavy Support garage - unlocks King Tiger tank and the Marder 2 Tank Destroyer.

Each garage costs 200 metal to build.
The garage are buildable, destroyable, and fixable.
The garage can be hit by wrenches to increase their build times.

Once a garage is built and fully online, ALL classes can build vehicle constructs! You are required to be near the respective garage of the vehicle construct. Once the vehicle construct is created, you must build it!

non-Engies can simply melee the vehicle construct and metal will be applied but it's slower than Engineers. Engineer's can build up constructs faster but it will drain their metal on each hit.

Once a vehicle construct is ready, simply hop on it (literally) and press reload. To get out of the vehicle, you press jump.

When you die as a vehicle, you will respawn as the same vehicle u died as. You will keep respawning as a vehicle UNTIL the garage required to build your vehicle is destroyed.

Vehicles take completely normal damage, they have no weaknesses or resistances.
Getting backstabbed as a tank will result in you taking 50 damage, having an outline for 15 seconds, and you take 2x damage for 15 seconds!
